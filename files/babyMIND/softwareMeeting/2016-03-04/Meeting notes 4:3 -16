Meeting notes 4/3 -16
raw = after digitization, no event selection.
look at Sabas values.

- Discuss the current status of the software, continuing the discussion from the general meeting on Wednesday. 

Decay in orbit explains the difference not explained by mu- capture
Measure in data to compare with simulation.

Can we in literature dig out mu- capture cross-sections?
Double check.
Decay in orbit, harder.

Check different physics libraries.
Also check fluka simulations. (with simpler geometry.)

Would be good to compare fluka and geant, simpler geometry.

Missing hits in the reconstruction. -> Fitted curve and charge id.

- Discuss the a new release. 

Cmp energy dep for energy dep in plastic.

- Progress of framework for multiple developers
Later than expected, waiting.

- IFIC VALENCIA
Invide Sascha to the Friday meeting.


Extra to do
Look at mean energy loss in Sci and Fe, for Fe hack in geant.

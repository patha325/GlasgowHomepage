Meeting 13/5-16

Attending
Etam
Saba
Ryan

Prel. agenda
- Merging software
Ryan, what conditions do we need to fullfill to migrate to gitLab?
How should we handle this?
Wait untill things are clear.
Migrate it until Thursday (night) next week 19/5-16.

Patrik Open question, when will INR they upload code?

- DAQ software
Ryan, integration DAQ with SaRoMaN. What are we expecting for the beam tests?
From Wednessday meeting, want event display from the testbeams. 
Saba, would be nice to visualize the data.
Ryan, Same beam as the one MIND will be on. Would be handy, software side, to be able to provide a caracteristic of the beam, depends on how many planes we have. PID using MICE EMR algorithms, will help for/with the MIND reconstruction. 

How many active planes for AIDA beam test, 

Can do visualization for low amount of hits.

Want to do low level pid.

Patrik, who does DAQ? Etam.

Etam, framework exists, can look at it. Firmware only gives hit amplitude as of now. 

Do you want binary data? 
Ryan, yes.
Data protocoll has been presented previously.
16/3 Indeco.

We have scripts in c and c#
Send that and binary file.

Ryan, how do configuration in the digitization. Database or textfile?

Etam, add to ToDo list. Which one should we use?

Consider using MICE database code.
Ryan will create a proposal.


- Current progress
Saba, no working simulations. Working at CERN. Code working with multiple hits.
Ryan, MICE took priortity 
Patrik, fixed fittedNodes, reconstructed momentum is to low, constant however.

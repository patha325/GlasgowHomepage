Ryan, how have calibration data?
XML or text file.
text file easier to parse, however
Etam, xml for frontend board. Configuration, not data.

Patrik mentioned simulation works, only issue now is clustering algorithms. Need to implement knowing plane number for hit.

Etam,
Pitch 10.25mm for bars
No gaps between modules.
Width 16mm
2 bars 15mm and aluminium.

Nice mechanics, and electronics.

Limited on cable lengths, can not predetermine position of cables on the front-end board. 
Module 96 cm x 96 cm.

Saba will provide proper maps.

- Test beam simulations

Meeting 15/4-16

Attending
Etam
Saba
Ryan
Tatiana

Schedule for next week
Talks for each of the simulations
Someone gives the framework talk and first results talk

Yes, Tatiana will try to connect remotely.

Saba, talk on the leaver arm,

Expecting ca 10 people at any time, more perhaps connecting.

Introducing a pickup coil,
PLans existed, but density of the coil was assumed to be very dense, now, very clear caps where this can be done. 

Now it is being done
Advantage of design

explicit flux change as we ramp magnet up and down.
change in coil gives explicit amplitude of the magnetic field.
See opera paper
testing if delta b depends on b as well as delta i
to be tested, may depend on b-h curve.
order 1 min to ramp up and down, low current.

press question to magnet guys can we do this for every plane? A subsett, motivation for field uniformety
uniformety in planes, along z? could affect tracking.

Compare electronic to e.g mice, weill have true analog signal from readout chip. 

- Progress of framework for multiple developers
Patrik, progress. Local gitlab. Not external yet.

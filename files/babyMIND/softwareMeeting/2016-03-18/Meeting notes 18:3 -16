Meeting notes 18/3 -16

- Discuss the use of timing to differentiate between on-time and off-time hits.
Etam updates, Sascha does a 100 ns cut during the reconstruction.

Photon comming from muon capturing.
Patrik has cut for 100 ns and 0.1 MeV.
Limit in bar, not known but we should be able to detect  0.1 MeV 

Cut in digitization,
Now removing data, should save it.

- Current progress.
Saba, are we averaging the position of hits in the bar? x,y,z. We just want to do z.

Patrik, systematic removing hits improves reconstruction and charge ID, problem with what is given to RecPack.

- Progress of framework for multiple developers
Patrik, No update yet.

- Extra
CERN collaboration meeting, all comming, hopefully someone from IFIC?
Do we want to have a sesion of the simulation, our software, hands on?
